# SQL-Fundamentals

This is a repository containing different levels of the SQL Fundamentals's solutions from DataCamp. 
It is surely very fun to practice them often and helpful to understand and write SQL queries from basic to intermediate and advanced levels.

I have splitted this repository into several folders as below:

1/ Introduction to SQL

1.1/ Selecting columns

1.2/ Filtering rows

1.3/ Aggregate Functions

1.4/ Sorting and grouping
