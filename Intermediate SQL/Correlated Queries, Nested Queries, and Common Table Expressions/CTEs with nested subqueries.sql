/* CTEs with nested subqueries
If you find yourself listing multiple subqueries in the FROM clause with nested statement, your query will likely become long, complex, and difficult to read.

Since many queries are written with the intention of being saved and re-run in the future, proper organization is key to a seamless workflow. 
Arranging subqueries as CTEs will save you time, space, and confusion in the long run!
