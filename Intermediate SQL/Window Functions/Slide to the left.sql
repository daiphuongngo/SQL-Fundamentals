Slide to the left
Sliding windows allow you to create running calculations between any two points in a window using functions such as PRECEDING, FOLLOWING, and CURRENT ROW. 
You can calculate running counts, sums, averages, and other aggregate functions between any two points you specify in the data set.

In this exercise, you will expand on the examples discussed in the video, calculating the running total of goals scored by the 
FC Utrecht when they were the home team during the 2011/2012 season. Do they score more goals at the end of the season as the home or away team?
