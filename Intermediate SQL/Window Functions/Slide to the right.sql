Slide to the right
Now let's see how FC Utrecht performs when they're the away team. You'll notice that the total for the season is at the bottom of the data set you queried. 
Depending on your results, this could be pretty long, and scrolling down is not very helpful.

In this exercise, you will slightly modify the query from the previous exercise by sorting the data set in reverse order and calculating a 
backward running total from the CURRENT ROW to the end of the data set (earliest record).
