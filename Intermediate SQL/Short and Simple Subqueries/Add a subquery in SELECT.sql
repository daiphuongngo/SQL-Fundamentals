/* Add a subquery in SELECT
In the previous exercise, you added a subquery to the FROM statement and selected the stages where the number of average goals in a stage exceeded the overall average number of goals in the 2012/2013 match season. 
In this final step, you will add a subquery in SELECT to compare the average number of goals scored in each stage to the total.
